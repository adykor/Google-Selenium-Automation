# Google Selenium Automation
This is an automation testing program written in C# that utilizes Selenium and NUnit frameworks to assert that a web page title matches the test's expected result - in this instance, Google. As part of the testing, the program: opens a Chrome browser window, navigates to the Google web page, expands the browser window, types something into the search bar, and closes the browser window.
