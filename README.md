# Google Selenium Automation
This is an automation testing program written in C# that utilizes Selenium and NUnit frameworks to assert that a web page title matches the test's expected result - in this instance, Google. As part of the testing, the program: initializes a Chrome browser window; navigates to the Google web page; expands the browser window; types something into the search bar; and closes the browser window.
